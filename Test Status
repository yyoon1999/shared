Windows 11 Pro Edition (Joined to extrqa2012.com domain) -> EXOS Switch -> FR 3.2.2 -> Locally authenticating

1) TLS
: Successful

2) PEAP
: inner-tunnel should be modified (uncommenting eap section)
: Successful

3) TEAP (Primary auth: TLS, Secondary: None) with private identifier: anonymous
: New inner-tunnel received on Feb 16, 2023
: Successful

4) Starting up Windows 11 with TEAP (3) configured => Further discussion is needed (see below Note).
: Initial Auth is failing during the login process
: After logging to domain, it's successful.

 Note: Response from Alan
  The Windows system is sending an empty EAP-Identity field.
  FreeRADIUS requires the EAP supplicant to send an identity.  Without the identity, we have no way of knowing who is being authenticated.
  We didn't see this in our tests with Windows, so I'm not sure what's going wrong here.   And in the end, this an issue with the Windows system.
  On our side, we could remove that check for a non-empty identity.  However, that would mean there would need to be some other way to identify the system being authenticated.
  
5) TEAP (Primary auth: TLS) with private identifier: someone@example.com
: Further testing is required.

6) TEAP (Primary auth: MSCHAPV2, Secondary: None) with private identifier: anonymous
: In testing.
